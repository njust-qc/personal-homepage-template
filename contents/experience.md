### **Simulation Platform Software Development**  
**June 2024 – Now**  

#### Core functions: algorithm interface development; real-time simulation and deduction; data collection and analysis; full-chain implementation of model interpretability.

#### Key Contributions:  
- A full-stack development simulation platform, using PyQt5 to implement the front-end interactive interface, designed based on the MVC architecture to achieve module decoupling, and using the Signal/Slot mechanism to enable cross-component communication. It integrates cooperative storage of MySQL relational data and Redis high-frequency data, with the interface response speed optimized to within 200 ms.
- Develop an open algorithm interface framework, integrate reinforcement learning algorithms such as MADDPG, and achieve over 100 simulations per second for adversarial scenario state synchronization through Redis Pub/Sub.
- Implemented the DeepSHAP algorithm based on the PyTorch Hook mechanism, independently designed a feature attribution visualization component, and generated four types of analysis views including feature importance distribution maps and SHAP plots.  

### **Cluster Game Evaluation and Interpretable Methods**
**August 2024 – Now**

#### Results: Invention patent

#### Key Contributions:
- Establish a simulation environment for multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms at sea, and develop an evaluation index system suitable for scenarios applying multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms; use a multilayer perceptron to comprehensively assess the various indicators in the evaluation index system, obtaining predicted values for algorithm performance evaluation, and improve the design of the loss function in the algorithm performance evaluation learning and training process; adopt an improvement based on the empirical conditional distribution.
- The Deep‑SHAP method is based on the SHAP method and the feature attribution concept of Shapley values. It interprets the predicted values of a multilayer perceptron and also visualizes the ranking of feature importance.
